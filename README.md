## Data Model

### Theme Object

Each theme object is composed of name-value pairs for:

- `_id`: unique ID auto-generated by Mongoose/MongoDB
- `name`: user-generated name for the theme. _"default"_ is the name for a Bootstrap theme with default values for each variable.
- `vars`: an array of theme variable objects. Each theme variable object has five properties:
  - `category`: the top level category for organizing and displaying variables. Categories for the button-specific variables are: Core, Geometry, Type, and Button
  - `subcategory`: each category is broken down into 2-8 subcategories to allow for hierarchical display
  - `variable`: the Bootstrap SASS variable name (including the `$` prefix)
  - `type`: the type of variable. Each variable type will have a specific UI and validation. Types include:
    - `color`: hex value for MVP; ideally, include rgb and rgba formats as well
    - `attribute`: a list of preset attributes for certain CSS values (cursor, font-weight, link-hover-decoration)
    - `font-family`: a list of font families; could be an attribute list or leverage Google Fonts API to display list of available fonts and access them(?)
    - `line-height`: a floating point value without units used for type styles
    - `size`: a number with units (px, em, %)
  - `value`: the literal value used by SASS. Values can be:
    - **_value_**: actual CSS value _("#ffffff" or "16px")_
    - **_variable_**: another SASS variable _("$font-family-base")_
    - **_function_**: a SASS function _("darken(#428bca, 6.5%)")_
